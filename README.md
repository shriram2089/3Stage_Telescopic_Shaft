# Telescopic_Shaft

This repository contains the design of a **3-stage, 6-shaft telescopic mechanism** developed as part of a product design Problem Statement for **InterIIT Tech Meet 2023**.  
The design is intended for applications involving the cleaning of **long, narrow, and hard-to-reach tanks**, where traditional manual methods or fixed-length tools are ineffective.

---

## 🛠️ Project Overview

Conventional cleaning tools have limitations when dealing with deep tanks that have restricted access.  
To address this, a **telescopic shaft mechanism** was designed to:

- Extend to a long reach while maintaining sufficient structural stability  
- Retract into a compact form for ease of handling  
- Provide smooth motion between telescopic stages  
- Support interchangeable cleaning attachments as needed for different tank geometries

This 3-stage mechanism consists of **six nested shafts** engineered to slide with minimal friction while retaining rigidity during operation.

## 📐 Key Features

- **Multi-stage telescopic extension** enabling access to deep and narrow tanks  
- **Lightweight yet structurally sound design** suitable for repeated manual operation  
- **CAD-optimized sliding tolerances** for seamless expansion and contraction  
- **Modular attachment compatibility** for various cleaning applicators  
- **Designed with manufacturability in mind**, considering cost and assembly constraints
